* **Interactivity:**
  * Dynamic project card filter grid.
  * Cursor-following mouse glow effect on skill cards using inline CSS custom properties mapping.
  * Interactive retro command-line interface (CLI) terminal simulator where visitors can query your profile.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

You can serve this static directory using any simple HTTP server:

### Option A: Python (Fastest)
Run the following in the portfolio directory:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

### Option B: Node.js (http-server)
Install and run `http-server` globally:
```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🌍 GitHub Pages Deployment

This repository is named `ahmadallkhayat.github.io`, GitHub's special naming convention for a user site — pages built from it are served at the account root rather than under a repo-name subpath.

1. Push this local directory to the repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git branch -M main
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: portfolio launch"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/ahmadallkhayat/ahmadallkhayat.github.io.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. In your GitHub repository:
   * Go to **Settings** -> **Pages**.
   * Under **Build and deployment** -> **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
   * Under **Branch**, select `main` and `/root`.
   * Click **Save**.
3. The portfolio will be live at `https://ahmadallkhayat.github.io/`.
